## Setup Guide

<Stepper.Root>
<Stepper.Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Panda project is set up and ready to go. If not, please refer to the
[Panda CSS Getting Started Guide](https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/getting-started#framework-guides) and once you've
completed that, come back to this guide.

</Stepper.Step>
<Stepper.Step title="Install Tacos UI components" number="2">

The first step is to install [Tacos UI](https://tacos-ui.com). To install Tacos UI, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install @tacos-ui/react
```

</Stepper.Step>
<Stepper.Step title="Install Tacos UI styled system" number="3">

The second step is to install `@tacos-ui/styled-system`. This package is used to have same design between components
library and your application.

```bash
npm install @tacos-ui/styled-system
```

</Stepper.Step>
<Stepper.Step number="3" title="Install Tacos UI Panda Preset">

The next package you will need is `@tacos-ui/panda-preset`. This package contains all the recipes and tokens explicitly
built for Tacos UI.

```bash
npm install @tacos-ui/panda-preset -D
```

After you've installed the presets, you'll need to add it to your Panda configuration file along with your preferred
`jsxFramework` like shown below:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev';

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@tacos-ui/panda-preset'],
  include: ['./node_modules/@tacos-ui/react/src/**/*.tsx', './src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  jsxFramework: 'react',
  outdir: 'styled-system',
  importMap: '@tacos-ui/styled-system',
});
```

Make sure to run `panda codegen` after you've added the presets to your Panda configuration file.

And that's it!
